# Commands

### Commands Usage

Rovolution believes in bringing as many features as possible to the users for free as you will be able to see below. All commands can be ran either as a slash command (e.g. _/verify_) or as chat commands (e.g. _!verify_). When the term 'user' is mentioned below that is their discord user and as such you can ping them (e.g. @catipilliar14) and when the term 'username' is mentioned that implies a persons Roblox username (e.g. catipilliar14).
