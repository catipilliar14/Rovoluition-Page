# Verification Support

### Verifying for the first time

If you are a new user to Rovolution we welcome you and hope you have a flawless experience with us. To link your account to the bot visit this [link](https://www.rovolution.me/verify), log in using Discord. Once you do this you will be directed to a page which will give you two options, we recommend you click 'Verify by Joining a game'.

This will then ask you to input your Roblox username into a box, you will have to start typing your username before it will give you the option to select yourself. For this example I will be using my username.&#x20;

After selecting your username you will need to click 'Verify with the username (your username)'. You will then be given a code and a link to a [game](https://www.roblox.com/games/7130833259/Rovolution-Verification).
