# Commands

### Commands Usage

Rovolution believes in bringing as many features as possible to the users for free as you will be able to see below. All commands must be ran as a slash command (e.g. _/verify_). When the term 'user' is mentioned below that is their discord user and as such you can ping them (e.g. @catipilliar14) and when the term 'username' is mentioned that implies a persons Roblox username (e.g. catipilliar14).
