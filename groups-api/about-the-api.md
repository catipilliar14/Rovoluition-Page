# About the API

## Hello Player, Welcome to the Ranking API

### About the API:

The ranking API allows you to manage your group from within a Roblox Game. This service is designed to be as user friendly as possible for anyone between new scripter to advanced programmer its designed for all to use. Rovolution Roblox API allows you to promote/demote/exile/accept join/deny join/set rank of users in your group from inside your Roblox game.

The API is quite complex to use so we create an [`API wrapper`](https://github.com/RovolutionTeam/Rovolution-Roblox-API-Wrapper)

The API is built fully serverless so it can handle huge changes in demand, you donâ€™t need to use the API wrapper you can make your own.

### Features of the API:

* Promote User
* Demote User
* Set User Rank
* Accept Join Request
* Deny Join Request
* Exile User

### What can the API be used for?:

The API can be integrated into automatic application services to gamepass ranking centres to in-game group management dashboards, the freedom is yours. In the future we aim to have public templates for users to be able to use for free.
